###Field Programmable Gate Array
-  **no physical layout design**: design ends with a bitstream used to configure a device
-  bought off the shelf and reconfigured by designers themselves

###ASIC vs FPGA:
FPGA is:
- off-the-shelf
- low development cost
- short time to market
- reconfigurability

###Major FPGA Vendors
- SRAM_based FPGAs 
  - Xilins, Altera,  (90% of market)
- Flash & antifuse FPGAs
  - Actel, Quick logic

##Xilinx 
primary products: FPGA and the associated CAD software
- CLB structure (Configurable logic black)
  - programmable interconnect adn programmable logic blacks
