##Routing

- Flavors of routing: global vs. detailed, area vs. region
- Our technical focus: area routing by **maze routing**

###3 basic routing problems
- size complexity 
  - divide & conquer
  - start with global routing, end with detailed routing
- shape complexity
  - coarse routing steps: Gridded
  - detailed routing steps:
    - underlying grid for all the pins
    - use gridless path search techniques to find paths
- timing complexity
  - first, make sure placement is good enough that you can hit timing
  - accounting for timing at each level of routing, from coarse to find
  - iterative improvement: identify problem, go back and try to fix them
  
###Global (Coarse) Routing
- chop up chip into big regions
- decide thru which regions the wires will go, but not exactly where each rectangle of each individual wire will go
- idea is to **plan** global paths for the wires, so we know early we can fit them all in each region when we ginally embed detailed rectangles

####Row based placment
- regions gor wiring called **channels**, pins on top & bottom
- used when you have only 2 or 3 layers of metal wiring
- global routing determines where row-spanning signals cross the rows, and where then horizontal extent of signals are placed

###Routing: global nad detailed
- repeat for each region until the whole chip is routed
- often get some unrouted nets which require some re-work by hand
