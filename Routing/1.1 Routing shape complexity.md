###Implementation:
####Algorithm 
Dijkstra'sAlgorithm
####2 key Data Structurs:
- routing grid **a 2-D array is just fine here**
  - holding cells of area to route, costs of each cell, blockages
  - mark these cells to know what cells you have already reached
  - maek predecessor in here too
- **Waveform**  
  - hold active cells to expand
  - cell info has pathcost, predecessor information
  - indexed on pathcost
  - always expand cheapest cell next
- for waveform , need something clever here, want fast insert/delete in cost here
  - option 1: HEAP
    - most routers fo it like this
    - min cost item is always at top
  - option 2: Cost-Indexed Array (hash-table)
