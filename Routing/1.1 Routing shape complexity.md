###Implementation:
####Algorithm 
Dijkstra'sAlgorithm
####2 key Data Structurs:
- routing grid **a 2-D array is just fine here**
  - holding cells of area to route, costs of each cell, blockages
  - mark these cells to know what cells you have already reached
  - maek predecessor in here too
- **Waveform**  
  - hold active cells to expand
  - cell info has pathcost, predecessor information
  - indexed on pathcost
  - always expand cheapest cell next
- for waveform , need something clever here, want fast insert/delete in cost here
  - option 1: HEAP
    - most routers fo it like this
    - min cost item is always at top
  - option 2: Cost-Indexed Array (hash-table)

- Today, heaps seem to be dominating, just a lot more flexible on what they allow you to do with costs.
- Interactions with the search algorithm to discuss
- what constraints have to met for this simple expand-cheapest-cell-next strategy to get the best path?
  - pathcost constraints
    - basic constraint: CONsistency
      - the cost of adding a cell to a path is independent of the path itself
      - it does not matter how you reached this new cell, it still adds the same cost to the path
      - guarantees we reach it once, and thus expand it just once
    - it is easy to create a cost function that is inconsistent and violates all these nice properties
      - penalize paths with bends (ie bend penalty=2)
      - implications:
        - reach same cells multiple times at different costs
        - same cell in wavefront multiple times at different costs

###smarter search : Rubin's scheme
- add predictor function to the cost
- direct the search toward the target
