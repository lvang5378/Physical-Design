###Unequal partition sizes
    Apply the KL algorithm with only min(|A|,|B|) pairs swapped

### Unequal cell sizes or unequal node weights 
     assign a unit area, i.e. the greatest common divisor of all cell areas

### k-way partitioning (generating k partitions)
     Apply the KL 2-way partitioning algorithm to all possible pairs of partitions
