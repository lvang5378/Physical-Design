##CMU lecture 13 Recursive placement: Min-cut
http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ee760/760docs/lec13.pdf


###Basic Idea:
- **Cut** the chip into 2 pieces, partition gates over the 2 sides, **minimize wiring** in between.  
- Can continue doing this recursively with results of each partition step

###Partitioning
- partition the gates between 2 regions so that
  - **capacity** (# of gates allowed) on each side is not exceeded
  - **cost** (I.e., the number) of wires across the cut is minimized
  
- Classical problem is bipartitioning

####Note: its very easy to do this poorly
Solution: iterative improvement

---

###KL and FM algorithms
- KL
  - core of all others
  - right idea - too slow
- FM
  - start with KL, made if fast
  - clever data structure, and some very minor treaks make the algorithm linear for n gates for one improvement pass
  - core of most serious partitioners today
  
---
###KL
- gain: 
  - change in cost that results from swapping one gate in the A-side with one gate in the B-side
- Be greedy, but persevere
  - **do the very best next swap**
  - do this swap even if it's negative...
  - so the swap to pick is the strictly biggest gain
    -biggest positive gain, smallest negative gain
- do all n swaps

####Hill climbing is critical 
  - by looking at all possible max gain swaps, and then picking the best sequence of max gain swaps, while tolerating individual swaps that are bad, you can get a much better overall solution
  
  
###How fast does KL run
- NOT
- it's possible to tag eery gate with some partial numerical info that can be used to calculate a single gain for a single swap, quickly
- still need to find the best: intrinsically requires sorting the gates by these numerical tags
- sort of n points is O(nlogn), but we do this n times, as 
  - (nlogn)+(n-1 logn-1) + (n-2 logn-2) .... 1(log1)
- this sum is**` O(n^2 logn) `**for big n


---
###FM
####Keeps the good parts of KL
- iterative improvement, with multiple passes, as before
- hill climbing, selecting best swap sequence
####New ideas, 
- better data structure for finding what to swap for max gain
- **clever accounting for what needs to get updated after cell moves**
- gates not just points anymore, they have size

###FM Basics
####    new constraintsï¼š balance criterion
- each cell i now has size s(i) so just having same # of cells in each partition is not enough, we need better defin of "balance"
- **balance criterion: want |A|/(|A|+|B|) = r for some 0<=r<=1**
- ideally want r around 1/2, but doesn't have to be exactly 1/2
- allow r to be in a range eg. 0.3, to 0.7
- user gets to pick this range of r

###FM Skeleton

###Finding the move of max gain
- observation
  - cell i has p(i) pins, it can attach to at most p(i) distinct nets
  - if you relocate cell i, the most you can affect the gain is p(i)
  - -p(i) <= gain <= +p(i)
- we can generalize this
  - overall,** the gain from any move is bounded by |max{p(i)}|**
  - suggests a data structure to exploit this...

###FM: Bucket sort data structures
![alt text](https://github.com/lvang5378/Physical-Design-Note/blob/master/placement/pics/FM%20Bucket%20sort%20data%20structures.PNG)
![alt text](https://github.com/lvang5378/Physical-Design-Note/blob/master/placement/pics/FM%20finding%20move%20for%20max%20gain.PNG)
- how much time to find max gain move?
  - constant time, O(1), just look at maxGain slot in buckets
  - also to **maintain maxGain in constant time, assuming you have to know where all the cells are; again just some pointer hacking**
  - to move n cells, FM is O(n), KL was O(n^2 logn)

- what's left?
  - how to update all gains of all affected cells when we move one cell"
  - KL assumed this was O(n) for a single swap ( you might to update all this cells), so was O(n^2) to do all n swaps
  - how do we improve on this?
  
###FM Improvement: Net criticality
- defn : distribution of a net n
- ** crtical net:**
  - **net n with (A(n), B(n)) critical if A(n) or B(n) = 0 or 1**
  
####Only cells on critical nets affect gain
- based on observation
- minor point 
  - need to look at nets that were critical before ou moved cell i, and nets that go critical after you move cell i
  - just a lottle more bookkeeping

####Using criticality

####Net updates
net update is the process of scanning all the cells on net i to see if they are critical (ie, are they connected to any other critical nets)
- **KEY RESULT:
  - you never have to do more than a constant number of updates on any net in one improvement pass of FM (Constant = 4, it turns out all their cells freeze they freeze to be noncritical)
  - little nets (2, 3 cells) after few moves
  - big nets (>=4 cells) adter few moves

##Terminal Propagation:
###Basic Idea
- represent, at least crudely, what's going on in the other partioions while you do each cut
- need somehow to create/represent a view of how global wires are evolving across cuts
###Mechanics
- you try to build a crude "geometric wire model " for the wires that are going across the other cuts and **use this to bias your current partitioning task **to minimize spreading connected objects across the current cut

- DK used a really simple striner heuristic
  - idea is to get a rough idea of where the global portion of wires connected to objects inside a live partition wants to go
  - get pseudo pin  (wires crosses the boundary of the current region, mark as pseudo pin)
- use the pseudo-pin to bias the current partiotion
  - use this to alter swapping cost function to favor swaps that keep modules close to their pseudopins
