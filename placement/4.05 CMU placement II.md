##CMU lecture 13 Recursive placement: Min-cut
http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ee760/760docs/lec13.pdf


###Basic Idea:
- **Cut** the chip into 2 pieces, partition gates over the 2 sides, **minimize wiring** in between.  
- Can continue doing this recursively with results of each partition step

###Partitioning
- partition the gates between 2 regions so that
  - **capacity** (# of gates allowed) on each side is not exceeded
  - **cost** (I.e., the number) of wires across the cut is minimized
  
- Classical problem is bipartitioning

####Note: its very easy to do this poorly
Solution: iterative improvement

###KL and FM algorithms
- KL
  - core of all others
  - right idea - too slow
- FM
  - start with KL, made if fast
  - clever data structure, and some very minor treaks make the algorithm linear for n gates for one improvement pass
  - core of most serious partitioners today

###KL
- gain: 
  - change in cost that results from swapping one gate in the A-side with one gate in the B-side
- Be greedy, but persevere
  - **do the very best next swap**
  - do this swap even if it's negative...
  - so the swap to pick is the strictly biggest gain
    -biggest positive gain, smallest negative gain
- do all n swaps

####Hill climbing is critical 
  - by looking at all possible max gain swaps, and then picking the best sequence of max gain swaps, while tolerating individual swaps that are bad, you can get a much better overall solution
