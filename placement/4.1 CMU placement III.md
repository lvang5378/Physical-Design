##Direct placement
https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ee760/760docs/lec14.pdf


- One issue is mathematical model: quadrativ wirelength minimization
- Second issue is legalization strategy: we do PROUD-style legalization.

###Strategy:Direct Placement
All these use a techinique called "Quadratic Placement"
- model all gates as moveable pointes, all wires as 2-point "springs"
- minimize total squared Euclidean length: **SUM[EuclideanLength^2(net i)]**
- surprisingly, can do initial parts of this directly, numerically, exactly

Geometric simplifications
- Gates: model as dimensionless points
- Grid slots: none, ie, **no placement grid, no "1 gate in 1 slot" constraints**
- Pins: **must be fixed somewhere around boundary of the chip**
- Wires: **we only allow 2-point connections**; we minimize SUM[length^2]

Multipoint wires
- in real netlists, can have a wire connect to >2 objects
  - if it connects to just 2 objects -"points" -called a "2 point net"
  - if it connects to >2 objects -called a "multipoint net"
- Idea:
  - decompose each multipoint net into a set of 2 point nets
  - necessary to be able use the quadratic wirelength model: square of the length ot the wire only really makes sense for 2 point net
  - how to decompose?
- Multi-point net  
    - suppose we have a 5 point net here, fully connected nets  
    - k-point net becomes [k*(k-1)]/2 2-point nets for us

Weighting the wires
- each wire can have a "weight"
  - specifies its importance in the minimization problem..
  - or that there actually are multiple wires between 2 objects
  - in this formulation, you can;t tell the difference  
- But what about a weighted multipoint wire?

Overall Model:

####Adding pads to the placement to prevent trival solution.

##Summary:
###Directed placement
- dimensionless points, 2-point weighted wires
- minimize sum of squared of wire lengths
- has a direct form representation of aggregate wirelength with function form **` 1/2*X^T*AT + b^T*X + const `**
- this is minimized at Ax = -b
- do x and y placement seperately

---

##Strategy: PROUD: a set of gates placement algorithm 
- recursive legalization by partitioning and refining
- use quadratic placement as starting point for a recursive strategy

###Idea:
- pick one of the region R1 of cut hierarchy
- propagate pseudo-pins to R1's cut boundary
- solve (quadratic re-place) region R1
- now pick next region, R2
- propagate puesdo-pins to R2's cut boundary
  - note some of these may be due to the most recent gate placement motions of solving R1
- solve (quadratic re-place) region R2
- pick next region R3. etc

####Iterations. 
- goes around this while loop 3-5 times at each level of the hierarchy
- we "propagate & replace " each region 3-5 times, which allows effects of global movements to be felt by everybody
why repeat this operation?
- ping-pong bach and forth thru subregions
- give objects in region a change to influence other regions

###Finalizing placement
1. does this create a legal placemnt by itself? NO
  - it does a pretty good job of global placement and guaranteeing that you do not put more modules in any region than the area allows
  - but, it cannot really force individual gates into cell rows
2. solutionL
  - don't partition all the way fown to individual objects
  - go down to regions with many (10s) of objects, snap onto row grid, and then do iterative improvement based on swaps of modules
  - people do annealing down here, among other things....
  
##Summary
1. quadratic place
  - to get the initial placement
  - again, on each region of the cur hierarchy, to help legalize the region, to move objects to good place after they are forced to go in a region
2. recursive cutting
  - to force -right number of placable objects in each region
  - uses quadratic placement and psuedo-pins to do each region
3. final legalization
  - run above till each region has few tens of cells
  - then do iterative improvement


iterative improvement placement by annealing
  - the approach in the 1980s, runs out of gas at a few 100,000 gates
rucursive mincut placers
  - based on clver, iterative improvement partitioning
  - **`coming back into style today, very good for very large ASICs`**
Quadratic direct placemnt
  - point-based, 2-point-wires; can minimize quadratic wirelen exactly, fast
  - but placemetn not really legal(overlaps) lots of work
Today:
  - **`mix of quadratic and mincut techniques to do "gross" placement; iterative improvement "local refinement" to get legal final placement`**
  - this is really how people really do millions of gates today...
