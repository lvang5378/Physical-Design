##Direct placement

- One issue is mathematical model: quadrativ wirelength minimization
- Second issue is legalization strategy: we do PROUD-style legalization.

###Strategy:Direct Placement
All these use a techinique called "Quadratic Placement"
- model all gates as moveable pointes, all wires as 2-point "springs"
- minimize total squared Euclidean length: **SUM[EuclideanLength^2(net i)]**
- surprisingly, can do initial parts of this directly, numerically, exactly

Geometric simplifications
- Gates: model as dimensionless points
- Grid slots: none, ie, no placement grid, no "1 gate in 1 slot" constraints
- Pins: must be fixed somewhere around boundary of the chip
- Wires: we only allow 2-point connections; we minimize SUM[length^2]
