##Direct placement
https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ee760/760docs/lec14.pdf


- One issue is mathematical model: quadrativ wirelength minimization
- Second issue is legalization strategy: we do PROUD-style legalization.

###Strategy:Direct Placement
All these use a techinique called "Quadratic Placement"
- model all gates as moveable pointes, all wires as 2-point "springs"
- minimize total squared Euclidean length: **SUM[EuclideanLength^2(net i)]**
- surprisingly, can do initial parts of this directly, numerically, exactly

Geometric simplifications
- Gates: model as dimensionless points
- Grid slots: none, ie, **no placement grid, no "1 gate in 1 slot" constraints**
- Pins: **must be fixed somewhere around boundary of the chip**
- Wires: **we only allow 2-point connections**; we minimize SUM[length^2]

Multipoint wires
- in real netlists, can have a wire connect to >2 objects
  - if it connects to just 2 objects -"points" -called a "2 point net"
  - if it connects to >2 objects -called a "multipoint net"
- Idea:
  - decompose each multipoint net into a set of 2 point nets
  - necessary to be able use the quadratic wirelength model: square of the length ot the wire only really makes sense for 2 point net
  - how to decompose?
- Multi-point net  
    - suppose we have a 5 point net here, fully connected nets  
    - k-point net becomes [k*(k-1)]/2 2-point nets for us

Weighting the wires
- each wire can have a "weight"
  - specifies its importance in the minimization problem..
  - or that there actually are multiple wires between 2 objects
  - in this formulation, you can;t tell the difference  
- But what about a weighted multipoint wire?

####Adding pads to the placement to prevent trival solution.

##Summary:
###Directed placement
- dimensionless points, 2-point weighted wires
- minimize sum of squared of wire lengths
- has a direct form representation of aggregate wirelength with function form **` 1/2*X^T*AT + b^T*X + const `**
- this is minimized at Ax = -b
- do x and y placement seperately

##Strategy: PROUD: a set of gates placement algorithm 
- recursive legalization by partitioning and refining
- use quadratic placement as starting point for a recursive strategy

###Idea:
- pick one of the region R1 of cut hierarchy
- propagate pseudo-pins to R1's cut boundary
- solve (quadratic re-place) region R1
- now pick next region, R2
- propagate puesdo-pins to R2's cut boundary
  - note some of these may be due to the most recent gate placement motions of solving R1
- solve (quadratic re-place) region R2
- pick next region R3. etc

####Iterations. 
- goes around this while loop 3-5 times at each level of the hierarchy
- we "propagate & replace " each region 3-5 times, which allows effects of global movements to be felt by everybody
