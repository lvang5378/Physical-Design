#### Min-cut Placement.
- Uses partitioning algorithms to divide **(1) the netlist and (2) the layout region** into smaller sub-netlists and sub-regions  

- Conceptually, each sub-region is assigned a portion of the original netlist  

- **`Each cut` heuristically minimizes the number of cut nets using**, for example,
  - Kernighan-Lin (KL) algorithm
  - Fiduccia-Mattheyses (FM) algorithm
