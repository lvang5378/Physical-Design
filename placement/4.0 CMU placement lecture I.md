###Classical placer optimization goals:
1. minimize total estimated wirelength
2. Congestion minimization:
  - take any cut through the placement, count the number of the nets that cross this cut line
  - for every cut line, placer tries to **minimize this crossing count.**


###A simple model shows how wirelength, congestion relate
- make several univormly spaced cuts across layout, both directions
- count unm of wires that must cross each cut, plot values as histogram  

      Note: area under each histogram corrlates with (but is not same as) estimated wirelength  
      Typically, we want to "flatten" there histograms, so there are no regions with more wires 
      than the max num of wires that will fit. We areespecially sentive to the peaks in these plots, since they are
      likely hotspots for congestion.

###Three big placer strategies:
1. recursive (bipartitioning)
  - recursively partioion the netlist onto halves of the chip
  - we cover, KL and FM
2. iterative improvement
  - perturb a random placemnt repeated until it stops getting better, 
  - we cover, SA
3. Direct (Quadratic)
  - write an equation ( a big one) whose numerical solution = a placement
  - we cover, classical quadratic placement

###Recursive Placement
usually called in-cut placement
  - **min-cut minimize confestion directly, does't minimize wireleng directly**

###Iterative placement
optimizations:
  - incremental cost calculation
      - don't recompute the cost of each net in the entire placement after do one measly little swap
      - most lengths didn't change, just look at the wires that could change
  - range limiting
      - you don't get any rewards for proposing moves that have a very high probabolity of being rejected - rejected moves don't advance solution
      - range = amount by which the cost is likely to change if you do this move
