##Comparison

1. Component dependency of partitioning algorithms
  - KL is based on the number of edges
  - FM is based on the number of nets

2. Time complexity of partitioning algorithms
  - KL has cubic time complexity
  - FM has linear time complexity

###Drawbacks of KL algorithm 
1. The K-L heuristic handles only unit vertex weights.
  - Vertex weights might represent block sizes, different from blocks to blocks.
  - Reducing a vertex with weight w(v) into a clique with w(v) vertices and edges with a high cost increases the size of the graph substantially.
2. The K-L heuristic handles only exact bisections.
  - Need dummy vertices to handle the unbalanced problem.
3. The K-L heuristic cannot handle hypergraphs.
  - Need to handle multi-terminal nets directly.
4. The time complexity of a pass is high, O(n3).
