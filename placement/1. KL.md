##Kernighan–Lin algorithm

> Kernighan–Lin is a O(n^2 log(n)) heuristic algorithm for solving the <b>graph partitioning</b> problem. 
The algorithm has important applications in the layout of digital circuits and components in VLSI.

###Description
Let G(V,E) be a graph, and let V be the set of nodes and E the set of edges. The algorithm attempts to find a partition of V into two disjoint subsets A and B of equal size, such that the sum T of the weights of the edges between nodes in A and B is minimized. Let I_{a} be the internal cost of a, that is, the sum of the costs of edges between a and other nodes in A, and let E_{a} be the external cost of a, that is, the sum of the costs of edges between a and nodes in B. Furthermore, let

    D_{a} = E_{a} - I_{a}
be the difference between the external and internal costs of a. If a and b are interchanged, then the reduction in cost is

    T_{old} - T_{new} = D_{a} + D_{b} - 2c_{a,b}
where c_{a,b} is the cost of the possible edge between a and b.

The algorithm attempts to find an optimal series of interchange operations between elements of A and B which maximizes 
T_{old} - T_{new} and then executes the operations, producing a partition of the graph to A and B.[1]

###Pseudocode
     1  function Kernighan-Lin(G(V,E)):
     2      determine a balanced initial partition of the nodes into sets A and B
     3      
     4      do
     5         compute D values for all a in A and b in B
     6         let gv, av, and bv be empty lists
     7         for (n := 1 to |V|/2)
     8            find a from A and b from B, such that g = D[a] + D[b] - 2*E(a, b) is maximal
     9            remove a and b from further consideration in this pass
     10           add g to gv, a to av, and b to bv
     11           update D values for the elements of A = A \ a and B = B \ b
     12        end for
     13        find k which maximizes g_max, the sum of gv[1],...,gv[k]
     14        if (g_max > 0) then
     15           Exchange av[1],av[2],...,av[k] with bv[1],bv[2],...,bv[k]
     16     until (g_max <= 0)
     17  return G(V,E)

##My conclusion:
###D(v) = |Ec(V)| - |Enc(V)|
        Ec(V): # edges <b>cut</b> by cutline
        Enc(V): # edges not cut by cutline
###delta g(a, b) = D(a) + D(b) - 2* c(a,b),
        c(a,b) is the connection weight between a and b:
        If an edge exists between a and b, then c(a,b) = edge weight (here 1), 
        otherwise, c(a,b) = 0.     
    The gain g indicates how useful the swap between two nodes will be
    The larger g, the more the total cut cost will be reduced 
###The goal is to find a pair of nodes a and b to exchange such that g is maximized and swap them.

    step 0.
        - V=2n nodes
        {A, B} is an initial arbitrary partitioning
    step 1.
        - i=1;
        - compare D(V) for all nodes v in V
    step 2.
        - Choose ai and bi such that delta g is maximized,
        - swap and fix ai and bi ****
    step 3.  
        - if all nodes are fixed, go to next step, 
        - otherwise, go to step 2, find another g(a, b)
    step 4.   
        - find the movement sequence 1....m, such that Gm = sum(delta gi) is maximized, 
        - if Gm>0 go to step 5, otherwise, end
    step 5.
        - execute m swaps, reset remaining nodes
        - Go to step 1
