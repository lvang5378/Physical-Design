#ILP          
Both dynamic programming and B&B are smart enumeration techniques   
DP requires optimality structure  
B&B is general, backbone of mainstream ILP solvers  


##B&B (branch and bound)
Enumerate a decision tree  
Pruning out some branches to reduce the enumeration  

###Both Simulated Annealingn and generic are iterative probabilistic algorithm 
###BB, DP, and Greedy are constructive deterministic algorithm.
