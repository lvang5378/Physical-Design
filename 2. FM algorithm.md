##Gain delta_g(c) for cell c

####delta_g(c)  = FS(c) – TE(c) , 

where 
- the “moving force“ FS(c) is the number of nets connected to c but not connected to any other cells within c’s partition, i.e., cut nets that connect only to c, and 

- the “retention force“ TE(c) is the number of uncut nets connected to c.



The higher the gain delta_g(c), the higher is the priority to move the cell c to the other partition

##Maximum positive gain Gm of a pass
    The maximum positive gain Gm is the cumulative cell gain of m moves that produce a minimum cut cost. 

    Gm  is determined by the maximum sum of cell gains delta_g over a prefix of m moves in a pass 
## Ratio factor
The ratio factor is the relative balance between the two partitions with respect to cell area.  
It is used to prevent all cells from clustering into one partition.   
The ratio factor is defined as:  

      r = area(A)/ (area(A)+area(B))
where area(A) and   


##Balance criterion
The balance criterion enforces the ratio factor.  
To ensure feasibility, the maximum cell area areamax(V) must be taken into account.  
A partitioning of V into two partitions A and B is said to be balanced if   

         [ r ∙ area(V) – areamax(V) ] ≤ area(A) ≤ [ r ∙ area(V) + areamax(V) ]


##Base cell
A base cell is a cell c that has maximum cell gain g(c) among all free cells, and whose move does not violate the balance criterion. 

##Pseudocode

    step 0:
      compute the balance criterion
    step 1:
      compute the cell gain delta_g of each cell
    step 2: i=1
      choose base cell ci that has maximal gain delta gi move this cell
    step 3:
      fix the base cell ci
      update all cells gains that are connected to critical nets via the base cell ci
    step 4:
      if all cells are fixed, go to step 5 if not:
        choose next base cell ci' with maximal gain delta gi and move this cell
        i=i+1 go to step 3
    step 5:
      determine the best move sequence c1, c2, .... cm so that Gm  = sum delta  gi is maximized 
      if Gm>0, go to step 6 otherwise, end
